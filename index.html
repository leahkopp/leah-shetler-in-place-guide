      <p>On March 19, 2020 governor Gavin Newsom ordered an indefinite, state-wide <i>shelter in place</i> order to mitigate the spread of the notorious COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that we were ordered to stay in our homes while allowing people to venture out only to meet essential needs. When we did venture outside to grocery shop, we were ordered to maintain <i>social distance</i> of at least six feet. These new regulations were strange and freedom-stripping, but they were enforced to support the general health and well-being of many Americans.
      </p>
      <p>Shelter in place was a concept I had never heard of before, and I think many of us kind of felt like the world was ending. Most businesses closed and others were only open for emergency situations. Given so much time at home, I’ve put together this site as a resource of things to do while sheltering in place. During this time I read many books, cooked recipes, catered to my indoor plant garden, and discovered new music. Use this guide to give you inspiration while you experience this strange time in history. Most of all stay healthy friends!
